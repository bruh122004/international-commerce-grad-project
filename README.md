# international-commerce-grad-project
A repo dedicated for documenting my journey over my apprentice years.
Project overview
Good — that’s the right stage to be in: curiosity without delusion. The project *is* complex, but you can absolutely chip away at it piece by piece. Think of it as a series of **independent research modules**, not one gigantic “learn everything about global trade” death march.

Here’s a practical breakdown in order of dependency:

---

### **1. Trade Mechanics (How the money and goods actually move)**

**Goal:** Understand the flow of an international transaction.

* **Learn:**

  * What import/export means in real logistics terms.
  * Incoterms (EXW, FOB, CIF) — who pays for what, and when.
  * The role of *bill of lading*, *commercial invoice*, *certificate of origin*.
* **Resources:**

  * WTO “Trade for Beginners” guides.
  * YouTube: *“How a Letter of Credit works”* — surprisingly clear explanations.

---

### **2. Trade Finance & Risk**

**Goal:** How money fuels trade deals and who carries risk.

* **Learn:**

  * What “trade finance” is — banks lend against goods in transit.
  * Instruments like *letters of credit*, *factoring*, *invoice financing*.
  * Basics of risk management and insurance in trade (political, credit, shipping risk).
* **Focus terms:** *Working capital, escrow, collateral, default risk.*

---

### **3. Financial Regulation & Compliance**

**Goal:** What rules you must follow to hold or move other people’s money.

* **Learn:**

  * Anti–Money Laundering (AML), Know Your Customer (KYC).
  * Licensing: are you a financial intermediary, a crowdfunding platform, or an exchange?
  * How cross-border investment is taxed or limited.
* **Focus countries:** Algeria (home jurisdiction), and the EU (since it’s your likely trading partner).

---

### **4. Platform Architecture (Technology & Data)**

**Goal:** How such a system might be implemented safely.

* **Learn:**

  * How escrow and milestone verification could be done programmatically.
  * Fintech infrastructure: APIs for payments, identity verification, document validation.
  * Blockchain/smart contract use cases for escrow or asset tokenization (not hype — actual protocols like *Stellar* or *Polygon*).

---

### **5. Investment Mechanics**

**Goal:** Understand how people invest in trade deals.

* **Learn:**

  * Difference between *equity crowdfunding* and *debt-based funding*.
  * Return structures: fixed interest vs. profit share.
  * Legal templates for investment contracts.

---

### **6. Business Model Design**

**Goal:** Decide how *you* make money.

* **Learn:**

  * Platform fees, spreads on funding, or success commissions.
  * How to manage default risk while staying profitable.
  * Case studies: *Kickfurther*, *Trade Finance Market*, *InvoiceFair*.

---

### **7. Legal Formation & Partnerships**

**Goal:** Understand who you’d need to work with.

* **Learn:**

  * How to register a financial service startup (or partner with an existing licensed entity).
  * What banks, insurers, or logistics firms must be in your network.

---

### **8. Market & User Research**

**Goal:** Identify your real users.

* **Learn:**

  * Where small importers/exporters in your region struggle most (financing, documentation, trust).
  * How investors think about risk and liquidity.

If you research one module per week — just enough to understand key terms and relationships — you’d have a *complete conceptual map* in two months. Then you can decide if it’s a viable business, a technical experiment, or both.

Would you like me to order these modules into a **2-month roadmap with specific sources per week** so you don’t drown in material?
